# 🌍 Domain Suggestion

## 🌡️ Domain: Global Warming & Climate Change  

Global warming refers to the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due
to the buildup of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and
nitrous oxide (N₂O). Climate change includes not only rising temperatures but
also extreme weather events, shifts in precipitation patterns, melting glaciers,
and sea-level rise. The last decade has been the hottest in recorded history.

📊 Data science plays a critical role in tracking, analyzing, and forecasting
the impacts of global warming. Techniques such as time series forecasting
(e.g., ARIMA), clustering, regression modeling, and spatial analysis are
commonly used to interpret patterns and build predictive models.
