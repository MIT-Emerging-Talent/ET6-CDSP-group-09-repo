## 🌡️ Domain: Global Warming & Climate Change  

Global warming refers to the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due
to the buildup of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and
nitrous oxide (N₂O). Climate change includes not only rising temperatures but
also extreme weather events, shifts in precipitation patterns, melting glaciers,
and sea-level rise. The last decade has been the hottest in recorded history.

📊 Data science plays a critical role in tracking, analyzing, and forecasting
the impacts of global warming. Techniques such as time series forecasting
(e.g., ARIMA), clustering, regression modeling, and spatial analysis are
commonly used to interpret patterns and build predictive models.

### Research Questions

- How have global mean temperatures evolved year by year over the past
  century?
- What is the correlation between atmospheric CO₂ levels and global
  temperature anomalies?
- Which countries have experienced the fastest rate of warming between 1900
  and 2024?
