# ðŸ”Ž Research Question

Urban air pollution is a complex, region-specific issue, with different pollutants
posing distinct health risks. Identifying which pollutant dominates in a city
can help explain variations in disease burden and guide more targeted interventions.

This project seeks to answer the following question:

> ***How do respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes in 2024 vary across global
cities categorized by their dominant air pollutant?***

This question stems from rising concerns about air quality and its direct impact
on human health. Many of us have personally experienced or witnessed the effects
of poor air conditions. That connection inspired us to explore the link between
environmental data and public health outcomes.

By focusing on the **dominant air pollutant** in each city, we aim to go beyond
general pollution levels and identify *which specific pollutants* are most strong
associated with adverse health impacts. Our goal is to generate insights that  
can inform both public awareness and policy decisions.

This direction fits well within the **limited scope and timeline** of our project,
and reflects practical constraints such as **data availability**, **domain  
familiarity**, and the need for a focused, feasible analysis.
