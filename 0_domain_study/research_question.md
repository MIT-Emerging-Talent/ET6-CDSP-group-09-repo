# ðŸ”Ž Research Question

Air pollution remains a major environmental health concern worldwide, with
**PMâ‚‚.â‚… recognized as one of the most harmful pollutants** due to its ability
to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. Understanding the
long-term effects of PMâ‚‚.â‚… on human health is especially important for
shaping effective public health responses. Based on this well-established
evidence, we decided to focus our study primarily on
**PM2.5 and its long-term impacts**.

This project seeks to answer the following research question:

_To what extent have ambient PMâ‚‚.â‚… concentrations (2010â€“2019) influenced the
burden of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases across countries with
varying socio-demographic development levels, and how might this long-term
exposure relate to COVID-19 mortality outcomes?_

By focusing on **long-term exposure to PMâ‚‚.â‚…**, rather than general air quality
levels, our study aims to uncover **pollutant-specific health impacts**. We
combine historical PMâ‚‚.â‚… data with disease burden indicators and consider
socioeconomic context (via the **Socio-demographic Index, SDI**) to provide a
deeper understanding of **environmental health disparities**.

This focused research direction fits well within the scope of our project
timeline and available data and is designed to produce **actionable insights**
that can inform public health policy and raise awareness about the
**human cost of long-term air pollution exposure**.
