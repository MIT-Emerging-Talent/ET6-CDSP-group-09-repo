# Domain Research: Global Air Pollution ![earth](../notes/images/air_pollution_earth.gif)

Welcome to the domain study folder for our research on **air pollution and its
 effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health** across global cities. This
 folder organizes everything we've learned about the research area, and it's
 meant to help any new reader quickly understand the key concepts, brainstorming
and background review.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

This folder includes:

- Brainstorming
- Background summaries about air pollution and health
- Summary of our understanding
- Key terms and pollutant definitions
- Helpful articles, PDFs, and links

---

## What You’ll Find Here

### 1. `background_review.md`

Summary of current understanding of:

- Air Pollution as a Global Health Crisis
- Major Pollutants and Their Health Pathways
- Why Focus on the Dominant Pollutant?
- Regional Signatures and Pollution Sources
- The Pollutant Composition Index (PCI)
- Beyond Exposure: Integrating Health Burden Data
- Analytical Value and Research Gap

### 2. `key_terms.md`

Definitions and short explanations of key domain concepts:

- AQI (Air Quality Index)
- Dominant pollutant
- Respiratory vs. cardiovascular diseases

### 3. `sum_of_group_understanding.md`

Captures our collective understanding of the domain based on
our initial research, discussions, and individual explorations. It reflects
how we’ve connected scientific findings with real-world health challenges
and why we’re focusing on dominant air pollutants.

### 4. `resources_links.md`

A list of:

- Data sources (e.g., WHO, OpenAQ, IHME)
- Articles or reports that helped us understand the domain

## File Organization

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `background_review.md` | What’s already known about air pollution and health |
| `key_terms.md` | Glossary of relevant terms |
| `brainstorming` | Convergent and divergent thinking |
| `sum_of_group_understanding.md`| general understanding and our shared knowledge|
| `problem_statement.md` | Highlights the needs and the challenges |
| `research_question.md` | A clear statement of the research question |
| `resources_links.md` | Useful links |

---

## How This Helps Our Research

Understanding the domain lets us:

- Know what has already been studied
- Make sure our research question aligns the FRESCO & PICOT evaluation

This folder gives context to our question:  
**"How do respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes in 2024 vary across
global cities categorized by their dominant air pollutant?"**
