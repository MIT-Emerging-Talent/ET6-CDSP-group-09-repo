# Exploratory Data Analysis for the final pm2.5 dataset (EDA)

The exploratory analysis for[`final pm2.5,sdi and Daly`](../final_datasets/clean_merged_data.csv)
dataset is thoroughly documented in the
dedicated notebook:  
[`Exploratory_trends`](../4_data_analysis/02_exploratory_trends.ipynb).

This notebook is located in the `4_data_analysis` folder, which is structured
specifically for in-depth data exploration and trend visualization. Placing the
EDA there allows for better organization, reuse, and linkage with related files
â€” especially those used for transformation, and modeling preparation.

We recommend reviewing that file directly, as it provides clearer
visualizations, smoother narrative flow, and is integrated with other
exploratory steps. Reviewing it will give you a much better understanding of
the patterns in the data and the reasoning behind the modeling decisions in our reports.
