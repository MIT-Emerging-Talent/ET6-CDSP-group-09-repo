# Meeting 25 Minutes

**Date:** August 11, 2025

---

We started the meeting by completing last week’s check-in survey, then moved
on to discussing our predicting tool. Sa’id shared that the work has been
challenging but is progressing, and it will take more time to complete,
so we will continue working on it in the next milestone. He also
suggested switching from Random Forest to Gradient Boost to improve
the tool’s accuracy, which we will discuss further in the next milestone.

We then reviewed our website and addressed some issues, such as correcting
the link name. After that, we went through the syllabus and deliverables,
assigning the final tasks among the team.

This was our last meeting for Milestone 4 **Communicating Results**, and we want
to thank the team for their hard work.
