**Topic:** Communication Tool & Audience Strategy  

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Target Audience Exploration  

The team evaluated a range of potential audiences and began narrowing the focus
toward organizations and individuals engaged in data-driven health research.  
Several audiences were excluded due to
limited alignment with the project's technical complexity and communication objectives.

A promising direction is the **Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
(IHME)**, given the project's strong reliance on IHME-related datasets and
methodologies, including:

- GBD (Global Burden of Disease)  
- SDI (Socio-Demographic Index)  
- DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)  

While no final audience has been confirmed, IHME remains a primary candidate for
future outreach and showcasing the communication tool.

The team is currently leaning toward developing an interactive website/tool
to present key findings in a visual and accessible manner.
