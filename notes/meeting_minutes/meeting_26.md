# Meeting 26 Minutes

**Date:** August 16, 2025

---

We began the meeting by discussing preparations for our final presentation
event. The team agreed to create a shared drive to collect and organize
presentation ideas. While we have not yet chosen a presenter, the leading
candidates are Said, Lina, Mohamed, and Saliha. We decided to revisit this
decision in a later discussion. The team also agreed that the presentation
should be completed by the end of this week, also Mohamed Tilal is
designing a custom Zoom background for the team to use during the final event,
ensuring a professional and unified look.

Next, we reviewed the progress on the website. Said Ibrahim and his son
Ibrahim did a great job and completed the long-awaited tool predictor, which
now allows us to add the
finishing touches and finalize the site. Said mentioned that he will
continue improving the module and will update us if accuracy can be increased,
though the current results are already good enough.

We then talked about the communication plan, specifically reaching out to
potential audiences as part of presentation preparation will be a good step.

The meeting closed with a reminder for everyone to keep their focus on the
presentation, since it is our top priority moving forward.
