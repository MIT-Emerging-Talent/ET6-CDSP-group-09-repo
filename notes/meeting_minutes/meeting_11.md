## ‚úÖ Key Decisions & Action Items

### 1. Dataset Selection

- We decided to use the **PM2.5 country-level annual concentration dataset
(2010‚Äì2019)** along with **respiratory and cardiovascular burden data from the
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) (2020‚Äì2021)**.  
- Our initial focus will be on **25 diverse countries** to explore trends in
PM2.5 exposure and related health outcomes.  
- We may expand to include more countries later for broader comparisons and
increased statistical power.  
- We will also explore the possible link between **long-term air pollution
exposure and COVID-19 mortality** as part of the extended analysis.

### 2. Research Question Update

- The research question will be revised to reflect the updated focus on
long-term PM2.5 exposure and its impact on cardiovascular and respiratory
health outcomes.

### 3. Document Revision

- All milestone documents from the previous phase will be reviewed and updated
to align with the new scope and datasets of the project.
