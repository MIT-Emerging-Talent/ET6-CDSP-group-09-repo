# 📝 Meeting 21 Minutes

**Date:** July 28th, 2025

We began by reviewing and improving our judge presentation, incorporating Evan’s
feedback and updating the results slide to better match our research question.
The team agreed that Sa'id will present on Thursday,
with a test run scheduled for Wednesday.

Salih was selected to handle tomorrow’s check-in, with Lina as a backup.
We emphasized the importance of focusing on milestone deliverables and
encouraged everyone to contribute ideas in our repository discussions,
so we can all review and study potential approaches. This will help us move
quickly into action right after the judge presentation.

The meeting concluded with completing this week’s check-in survey.
