# Meeting 22 Minutes

**Date:** 30 July 2025  
**Attendees:** 8 Members  
**Purpose:** 90-second presentation rehearsal and communication deliverables

## Summary

- Conducted several trial runs of the 90-second presentation; _Said_ will present.
- Concerns raised about slide control delays if Said doesn't handle slides himself
  (possibly results in 20 seconds delay).
- Presentation refined to include quantitative data predictions using our model
  (which aligned with WHO study predictions).
- Agreed to explore a **website** as a public tool to showcase the model; _Said_
  will investigate feasibility.
- Team will also consider alternative artifacts (e.g. report, leaflet) in case
  the website isn't feasible.
- _Mohammad_ will finalize and upload the presentation to Google Drive and
  contact _Evan_ to ensure submission readiness.

## Next Meeting

- Scheduled for Saturday to review progress and finalize deliverables before
  the Monday deadline.
