## ✅ Key Decisions & Action Items

1. We reviewed the data we previously cleaned and explored.  
2. We decided to create a discussion thread for divergent thinking about data
analysis.  

- Everyone should research and share their ideas on which types of
analyses we can perform, and add their thoughts there by the next
**meeting on July 7.**

3. We completed the group check-in form.
