The team discussed the completion of various tasks, including the analysis and
pull requests for COVID and PM 2.5 data. Saadet Kalender confirmed that she will
handle
the non-technical explanation and retrospective updates. We noted the absence of
some team members in the retrospective. Salih made clear that we need to add a
statement showing our certainty of the analysis and answering the research
question, the team debated the placement
of it but at the end deciding it should
be in the non-technical explanation. Finally we discussed the need to update the
data description and add the check in presentation to the repository.
