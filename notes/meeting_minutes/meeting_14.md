# üìù Meeting 14 Minutes  

**Date:** July 7, 2025  

---

- We began the meeting by discussing different data analysis methods we could use
for our project. After exploring different options, the team agreed to test
multiple methods and later compare the results to determine which one works best
for our research.
- Everyone is encouraged to contribute and add their ideas in
[`Data Analysis Divergent Thinking`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-09-repo/discussions/114)
discussion thread.

- Said Ibrahim shared that he has been working on heatwave-related data. While
it‚Äôs a valuable topic, we agreed to prioritize our main research question.
Therefore, Said and Mohamed will continue working on the heatwave topic as a
secondary task.

- To conclude, we assigned different members to specific analysis methods. We
also decided to move our next meeting to Thursday instead of Wednesday to allow
more time for progress.
