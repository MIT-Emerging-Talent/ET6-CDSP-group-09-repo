# Communication

Communication is essential to the success of any project. Our group is committed
to fostering clear and effective communication by providing the necessary tools
and channels to support both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.

---

## Communication Channels

This is a remote collaborative data science project in which all communication occurs
virtually. Team interactions take place through both synchronous and asynchronous
communication. To ensure seamless information exchange and effective task completion,
the team utilizes a variety of communication channels, each tailored to specific
communication needs. Below is a list of the channels used:

### Slack Channel

- Primary communication platform.
- Used to coordinate and discuss all aspects of the project.
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

### WhatsApp Group

- Used for quick feedback and real-time information exchange.
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication.
- Easily accessible by all team members around the clock.

### Google Meet

- Used to host scheduled team meetings.
- A synchronous communication channel.
- Meetings cover key milestones and important project decisions.
- Meeting minutes are recorded to document discussions and keep absent members informed.

### GitHub

- Central platform for task-specific and development-related communication.
- Primarily an asynchronous communication tool.  
  
**GitHub Features Used**:

- **Issues**: To communicate and track project tasks requiring attention or completion.
- **Pull Requests**: To review, provide feedback on, and discuss completed tasks
  before integration.
- **Project Board**: To visualize and manage the status of tasks across different
  project stages.
- **Discussion**: For in-depth conversations and collaborative input on specific
  aspects of the project.

## Availability

Outside of designated availability hours, team members remain reachable through
asynchronous communication channels.

  with a maximum duration of 1 hour.
- **Platform**: Meetings are conducted via Google Meet.
- **Rescheduling**: Meetings may be canceled or rescheduled in the event of timing
  conflicts or if the majority of team members are unable to attend.
- **Emergency Meetings**: Can be scheduled at any time during team availability
  hours as needed.
- **Additional Meetings**: Any team member may request a meeting during availability
  hours to address important issues.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: There is no fixed schedule for asynchronous communication,
  although it is preferred to occur within the defined availability hours when possible.

## Asking for Help

Team members are encouraged to seek assistance whenever they encounter challenges
with any part of the project. Depending on the nature and complexity of the issue,
the following methods can be used to request help:

- **Slack or WhatsApp**: Ideal for simpler issues that require quick feedback or
  clarification.
- **Request a Meeting**: For more complex problems or when detailed explanations
  or tutoring are needed, members can request an additional meeting with the group
  or specific teammates.
- **GitHub - "Help Wanted" Issue**: For technical challenges, especially those
  related to coding, team members can raise an issue labeled "help wanted" to
  initiate collaborative troubleshooting.
