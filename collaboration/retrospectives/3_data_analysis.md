# üìä Retrospective ‚Äî Milestone 3: Data Analysis

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- **Modular & Collaborative Workflow**  
  Splitting the analysis into five focused notebooks improved clarity,
  collaboration, and reproducibility. Step-by-step refinement
  allowed rapid integration of feedback and produced a robust output.

- **Scientific & Visual Insights**  
  Shifting focus to Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) improved interpretability and
  model validity. Visuals effectively translated key findings,
  revealing meaningful trends and improving communication.

- **Strong Team Dynamics**  
  Each team member contributed actively with support, ideas, and reviews.
  Effective task division and open communication kept the project aligned and productive.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Challenging

- **Initial Data & Visualization Pitfalls**  
  Early global-average plots were misleading, and identifying stratification
  needs took time. Initial modeling approaches were simplistic
  and required significant revision.

- **Model Interpretation & Metrics**  
  Explaining why a lower R¬≤ model was scientifically better proved
  conceptually challenging, especially in stakeholder communication.

- **Technical & CI/CD Hurdles**  
  Ruff linter errors revealed a learning curve in CI/CD tooling.
  Understanding datasets deeply and choosing appropriate models posed both
  technical and analytical obstacles.

## üí° What We Learned

- **Critical Thinking Over Metrics**  
  A high R¬≤ may indicate overfitting; generalizable models aligned with the
  problem domain are more important than perfect scores.

- **Stratification Enables Depth**  
  Early stratification by development level or SDI yields more actionable
  insights and avoids misleading aggregate trends.

- **Tooling Improves Workflow**  
  Consistent use of tools like Ruff improves code quality and
  streamlines CI processes. Automation can prevent last-minute formatting issues.

## üîÑ What We‚Äôll Improve Next

- **Smarter Analysis Foundation**  
  Start with stratified exploratory data analysis (EDA) to form better
  hypotheses from the outset.

- **Smoother Tech Operations**  
  Set up local pre-commit hooks for Ruff to avoid CI friction. Add internal
  deadlines to reduce submission stress.

- **Advanced Skill Building**  
  Explore mixed-effects models for stronger statistical inference. Continue
  diving into Universal AI (UAI) resources to enhance technical modeling skills.

## üéØ Strategy vs. Board Summary

### ‚úÖ As Planned

- Executed phased approach: Data Cleaning ‚Üí EDA ‚Üí Modeling ‚Üí Interpretation.
- Applied scoped feature engineering and maintained effective collaboration.
- Delivered actionable findings based on solid teamwork and structure.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Didn‚Äôt Work

- Initial modeling approach adapted from past work lacked rigor for this dataset.
- Data and model challenges were more complex and time-consuming than expected.

### ‚ûï Additions to Plan

- Developed new visualizations in response to feedback.
- Added analysis to interpret models with lower R¬≤ values.
- Resolved unexpected CI/CD issues related to formatting.

### ‚ûñ Removed or Changed Steps

- Dropped original model in favor of SDI-based methods.
- Removed shallow visualizations that didn‚Äôt add analytical depth.
