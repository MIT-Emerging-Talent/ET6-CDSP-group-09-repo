# üß† Retrospective

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- The ideation process brought in diverse perspectives and allowed us to converge
on a meaningful, data-driven research question.

- The team showed strong commitment, and meetings were generally well-attended
and productive.

- Decision-making was democratic, with majority rule keeping discussions focused
and fair.

- We successfully rooted the problem in personal experiences and applied systems
thinking to understand the broader domain of air pollution and public health.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Challenging

- Narrowing down the domain from several complex ideas took longer than expected.

- Communication wasn‚Äôt always consistent, leading to delays in alignment and decision-making.

- Some team members faced challenges with availability or online presence due
to external constraints.

- Structuring our discussions to avoid repetition and promote convergence
proved difficult at times.

---

## üí° What We Learned

- Consistent, proactive communication is essential for staying aligned
during early-stage ideation.

- Starting with personal stories and real-world motivations helps anchor the
research in relevance.

- Early consensus on roles, priorities, and direction can significantly accelerate
the research design phase.

- Domain expertise is key to framing a feasible and impactful research question.

---

## üîÑ What We‚Äôll Improve Next

- Assign clearer roles and responsibilities within the group to ensure smoother coordination.

- Improve asynchronous communication (e.g., via GitHub issues, Slack, or email summaries).

- Implement structured check-ins to reduce ambiguity and increase momentum.

- Build in buffer time for domain exploration and data validation to manage delays
more effectively.

---

## üéØ Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Team members introduced themselves and quickly agreed on a regular meeting schedule.

- Early task delegation helped build momentum and provided clear direction.

- Most meetings and conversations were efficient and focused on our shared goals.

- Collaboration platforms (Slack and WhatsApp) were set up early, making
communication smooth.

- Majority-rule decision-making helped us resolve topic selection challenges effectively.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We initially underestimated how much time coordination would take across
different time zones and schedules.

- The process of narrowing down our domain and defining a research question
took longer than anticipated.

---

### ‚ûï Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We introduced WhatsApp as an additional communication channel for quicker,
informal check-ins.

- A shared collaborative document was added to better manage group inputs and
summarize ideas.

---

### ‚ûñ Or remove extra steps?

- No major steps were removed. However, we consciously shortened the ideation
phase in later meetings to allow more time for converging on the research question.

### Linah Khayri

üß† **What You Learned**

The ideation process was diverse and helped us shape a clearer direction,
though I didn‚Äôt expect it to take this much time. This phase reminded me how
essential consistent communication is for staying aligned.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

Our discussions surfaced meaningful ideas and helped us move forward eventually.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

Communication within the group wasn‚Äôt as smooth as I had hoped.

## Salih Adam

üß† **What You Learned**

It took us longer than expected to choose a domain, which reduced the time we
had to converge on a research question. I learned it's important to move faster
than planned to allow room for unexpected delays.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

Our group meeting schedule worked very well. Everyone consistently showed up
and contributed meaningfully. Using majority rule for decision-making proved
effective and kept the process democratic and efficient.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

Our group's organization and decisiveness could be strengthened. Assigning a
dedicated coordinator role could help ensure that all parts of the
project are progressing in sync.

## Saliha Saadet Kalender

üß† **What You Learned**

I realized how important it is not just to generate ideas, but also to narrow
them down quickly. Early alignment on priorities can really help speed things up
and create clearer direction.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

Our team showed great commitment. Everyone stayed engaged, respectful, and open
to different perspectives. Supportive feedback kept motivation high.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**
Sometimes we circled around the same ideas without clear direction. More
clearly defined roles and expectations, along with regular check-ins, would help.

## Falaq Youniss

üß† **What You Learned**

We spent more time than expected deciding on a domain, which left us with less
time to shape the research question. I‚Äôve realized the importance of moving
quicker in the early stages.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

Meetings were productive and collaborative. Everyone contributed, and we moved
forward effectively.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**
We lingered too long in idea-gathering. Improving communication and
decision-making speed would help us use time more efficiently.

## Obay Salih

üß† **What You Learned**

This was a new and eye-opening experience. Learning how to craft a good
research question that is actionable and appropriate for data science was more
difficult than expected. I also realized how powerful it is to connect research
with personal experiences ‚Äî writing about my mother‚Äôs asthma helped humanize the
problem and made it more relatable.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

Working in a collaborative setting and learning from others helped shape my
understanding of problem framing. Reflecting on real-world issues gave a strong
foundation to our domain exploration.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

I struggled initially with choosing a topic and understanding how to scope it
for a data science project. More upfront discussion about the criteria for a
‚Äúgood‚Äù data science question would have helped me frame it better from the start.

## Huseinee

üß† **What You Learned**

I learned the critical importance of proactive alignment and swift
decision-making during the initial stages. A clearer, earlier consensus on our
core direction could significantly streamline later work.

‚úÖ **What Went Well**

The team's commitment and consistency in meetings (even though I had limited
participation due to power outages and other urgent commitments).

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

My online presence and participation. Our group also needs more structured
decision-making to converge faster on key directions like refining the research question.
