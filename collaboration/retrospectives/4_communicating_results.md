# üìä Team Retrospective ‚Äî Milestone 4

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- Reached a shared vision and target audience, tailoring content for
credibility and impact.

- Delivered a functional, visually engaging website that blends data analysis
with storytelling.

- Effective division of tasks and smooth collaboration across research,
design, and development.

- Adopted and integrated tools like Streamlit, HTML/CSS, AI-assisted web
development, and pre-trained Random Forest models.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- Audience definition came later than ideal, delaying content direction.

- Technical hurdles in backend integration for Python-based model deployment.

- Prediction tool integration postponed due to complexity.

- Limited between-meeting updates slowed some progress.

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Audience choice shapes both content and technical approach.

- Storytelling with data improves clarity and engagement.

- Deployment feasibility must be considered alongside model quality.

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

- Fully integrate the DALY prediction tool into the site.

- Gather early feedback from target users to guide design and messaging.

- Increase between-meeting updates for smoother progress.

- Strengthen skills in backend integration and interactive web features.

## üéØ Strategy vs. Board

- **What parts of your plan went as expected?**  
We followed the plan define the target audience, create a  
clear communication strategy, then decide the best format to present our work.  
The team agreed on developing a website and collaborated dividing  
tasks between research, design, and technical implementation. The final result
reflected our shared vision and met the standards we aimed for,
providing a credible platform to showcase our analysis and insights.

- **What parts of your plan did not work out?**  
We began manually coding a website, but it was harder than expected, so we
dropped it and switched to an AI-assisted approach.

- **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**  
Yes. We used AI agents to enhance the website beyond our own code, and added
plans for a prediction tool plus potential model improvements.

- **Or remove extra steps?**  
Yes. We dropped the manually coded website approach when it proved too
difficult, replacing it with an AI-assisted method.
