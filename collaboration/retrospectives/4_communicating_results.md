# üìä Team Retrospective ‚Äî Milestone 4

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- Reached a shared vision and target audience, tailoring content for
credibility and impact.

- Delivered a functional, visually engaging website that blends data analysis
with storytelling.

- Effective division of tasks and smooth collaboration across research,
design, and development.

- Adopted and integrated tools like Streamlit, HTML/CSS, AI-assisted web
development, and pre-trained Random Forest models.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- Audience definition came later than ideal, delaying content direction.

- Technical hurdles in backend integration for Python-based model deployment.

- Prediction tool integration postponed due to complexity.

- Limited between-meeting updates slowed some progress.

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Audience choice shapes both content and technical approach.

- Storytelling with data improves clarity and engagement.

- Deployment feasibility must be considered alongside model quality.

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

- Fully integrate the DALY prediction tool into the site.

- Gather early feedback from target users to guide design and messaging.

- Increase between-meeting updates for smoother progress.

- Strengthen skills in backend integration and interactive web features.

## üéØ Strategy vs. Board

- **What parts of your plan went as expected?**  
We followed the plan define the target audience, create a  
clear communication strategy, then decide the best format to present our work.
The team agreed on developing a website and collaborated dividing
tasks between research, design, and technical implementation. The final result
reflected our shared vision and met the standards we aimed for,
providing a credible platform to showcase our analysis and insights.

- **What parts of your plan did not work out?**  
We began manually coding a website, but it was harder than expected, so we
dropped it and switched to an AI-assisted approach.

- **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**  
Yes. We used AI agents to enhance the website beyond our own code, and added
plans for a prediction tool plus potential model improvements.

- **Or remove extra steps?**  
Yes. We dropped the manually coded website approach when it proved too
difficult, replacing it with an AI-assisted method.

## üë• Individual Reflections

### üë§ Mohamed Tilal

- üß† What I Learned

  - I learned the importance of choosing the right audience for any project and how
critical it is to build good communication with them so they truly care about
our work and its impact. This isn‚Äôt just about sharing facts, but about
understanding the audience you‚Äôre targeting and being confident in your work.
I also learned how to use Streamlit, a Python library for creating websites.

- ‚úÖ What Went Well

  - We successfully developed a website for our communication strategy and explored
different tools to achieve the best results.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Be Improved

  - We are considering creating a tool to predict DALYs using our machine learning
model. We are also thinking about changing the random forest algorithm to
improve the model‚Äôs performance.

### üë§ Falaq Majeed

- üß† What You Learned

  - Explored a variety of website AI agents that greatly assisted us in building
our websites, opening up an entirely new world in web development.

- ‚úÖ What Went Well

  - Reached a smooth and mutual agreement on our project direction, clearly
identifying our audience, and forming a solid vision for how we will craft our research.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Be Improved

  - The group should maintain higher engagement and provide updates at every step,
rather than relying solely on meetings. I hope that in the final milestone,
all members will actively collaborate on the final presentation

### üë§ Salih Adam

- üß† What you learned

  - How communication medium choice (in this case, a website) impacts
  accessibility, reach, and the way data is interpreted.
  - How to tailor messaging for a highly specialized audience by focusing on
  evidence-based content, clear data visualization, and professional tone.

- ‚úÖ What went well

  - Smooth team coordination on dividing research, writing, and technical tasks.
  - The final site successfully conveys key messages and provides a professional
  , credible impression suitable for organizations like IHME and WHO.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è What could be improved

  - Seeking feedback earlier from individuals in our target audience to better
  validate content and design decisions.
  - Improving my technical skills in building web interactivity so I can
  contribute more directly to future data presentation features.

### üë§ Linah Khayri  

- What I Learned

  - I learned how to merge scientific content, storytelling, and web design into
a cohesive platform and I gained new skills in the web development field
(html/css) with the help of LLMs and found it really interesting, while
also deepening my understanding of air pollution data and health impacts.

- What Went Well

  - We created a website that blends data-driven insights with human-centered
storytelling. Features like the PM2.5 size comparison and showing why it
matters and why it was our focus brought clarity to complex concepts.

- What Could Be Improved

  - Integrating the prediction tool into the site‚Äôs interface would make it
much more convenient for users.

### üë§ Said Abualroos

- üß†What I learned

  - How to interpret and clearly explain differences between in-sample and
out-of-sample R¬≤ results.
The importance of aligning features and avoiding re-fitting pre-trained models
to preserve model integrity.  
  - Gained experience in integrating cross-technology workflows, specifically the
challenge of finding a backend solution with Python support for building a
website front end and back end, highlighting practical
deployment constraints beyond data science.

- ‚úÖ What went well

  - Successfully used four pre-trained Random Forest models
consistently without retraining, increasing reproducibility.  
  - Facilitated clearer group discussions by bridging technical results with
accessible explanations.
Managed to adapt workflows towards practical application needs, even when
encountering challenges like backend support for Python in
web development environments.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è What could be improved

  - Incorporate per-category cross-validation or hold-out test splits to obtain
  more robust subgroup performance metrics.  
  - Explore or experiment with additional backend technologies or frameworks that
support Python better, to streamline deployment of data science models into web applications.
