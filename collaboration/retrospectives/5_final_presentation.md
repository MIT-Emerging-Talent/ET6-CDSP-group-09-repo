# 📊 Retrospective — Milestone 5: Final Presentation

## ✅ What Went Well

We developed and refined our website as the main communication tool. It
successfully combined backend data processing with a clear and engaging frontend,
turning complex PM₂.₅ and DALY results into accessible visuals. We kept improving
the site step by step throughout the milestone.  
We also prepared our final presentation, which connected the analysis and website
into a coherent story for our audience. Most of the effort went into the presentation,
which was challenging but turned out well in the end.

## ⚠️ What Was Challenging

Integrating backend and frontend took more time than planned, and handling missing
API data was not easy. Simplifying the concept of DALYs for a broad audience also
required multiple attempts. Preparing the final presentation was difficult because
it needed the right balance between scientific detail and accessibility.  
We also started late in this milestone, which cost us valuable time.

---

## 💡 What We Learned

We learned how to design a website that communicates scientific uncertainty in simple
terms, collaborate effectively across different roles, and align our analysis with
presentation needs. We also realized that clarity and storytelling are as important
as technical accuracy.  
Additionally, we learned new ways to make a strong presentation, how to keep the
audience engaged, and gained a deeper understanding of how websites function in
both frontend and backend.

## 🔄 What We’ll Improve Next

We will allocate more time for integration and testing in similar projects, improve
documentation, and add more robust error handling. We also see the value of starting
earlier and seeking feedback sooner to save time and improve outcomes.

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Board

- **What parts of your plan went as expected?**  
Building the website, implementing backend-to-frontend flow, and dividing tasks
across roles worked as planned.  
- **What parts of your plan did not work out?**  
Deployment steps and simplifying DALY explanations were more challenging than anticipated.
- **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**  
Country-level insights, API error handling, and interactive tools that went
beyond the initial plan.  
- **Or remove extra steps?**  
More advanced indicators and visualizations, which were de-scoped to keep the
website clear, accessible, and impactful.

## 👥 Individual Reflections

### 👤 Mohamed Tilal  

🧠 **What you learned**  
I learned new ways to make a good presentation and saw how important it is to
show results in a way that keeps the audience interested. I also learned more
about how websites work in both frontend and backend.  

✅ **What went well**  
We kept making the website better step by step.
Most of my work was on the presentation. It was not easy, but in the end it
turned out to a good one.  

⚠️ **What could be improved**  
We started late in this milestone and that cost us some time, I would have wanted
to start earlier. We also could have asked for feedback sooner to improve both
the website and the presentation faster.  

### 👤 Saliha Kalender  

🧠 **What You Learned**  

We discovered new ways to make technical results engaging and easier to follow
for a wider audience. Working on both the website and presentation helped us
understand how design and data can work together to tell a compelling story. We also
learned how to simplify complex data into a clear narrative while keeping key
technical details, and realized how important teamwork and clear communication are
in keeping the project on track.  

✅ **What Went Well**  
We improved the website continuously, making visuals and insights clearer at each
step. This steady progress helped the final presentation feel complete and
polished.  

⚠️ **What Could Be Improved**  
We started the milestone later than ideal, which limited time for refining both the
website and presentation. Collecting feedback earlier could have helped us make
improvements faster.  

### 👤 Obay Salih  

🧠 **What I Learned**  
Most of my reflections come from following the meeting minutes my team posted and
the ongoing discussions we had in our WhatsApp group chat. Staying connected there
helped me understand how the project evolved step by step. I learned how important
it is to communicate consistently, share progress, and keep the momentum going.
I also deepened my understanding of how different parts of the website link together,
which made me feel more confident in contributing.  

✅ **What Went Well**  
Even though I couldn’t always be there in person, I made sure to keep in touch
with the team through WhatsApp and by reviewing the shared notes. The website
kept improving at every stage, and the collaboration showed how much we can achieve
when everyone plays their part. I focused mainly on the presentation side, which
started as a challenge but ended up being one of our strengths. I also feel glad
that I was able to contribute and stay in sync with the team’s progress.  

⚠️ **What Could Be Improved**  
Because we started the milestone a bit late, we lost some valuable time that could
have been used to polish the website and presentation even more. For the next
milestone, I want to be more proactive in reaching out and joining in earlier,
rather than waiting for updates. Also, I hope we can share feedback sooner so
improvements can be made on the fly. Overall, I plan to stay more actively
connected—not only through chat but also by contributing more directly to the
work itself.  

### 👤 Linah Khayri  

🧠 **What you learned**  
We learned how to take complex research and turn it into a clear, engaging story,
and also how to strike the right balance between technical details and accessibility
for a broader audience.  

✅ **What went well**  
We made good progress on improving the website layout and refining the tool’s
functionality, which made our presentation feel more polished.  

⚠️ **What could be improved**  
We could manage our time better by starting the slides earlier, giving us more
space to polish. The voiceover and transitions also still need some fine-tuning
to make the flow smoother.  

### 👤 Said Abualroos  

🧠 **What I Learned**  
I learned how to turn complex data into a clear story for both technical and
non-technical audiences. Working on the website helped me understand how backend
data and frontend visuals can work together, and I improved my skills in communicating
uncertainty and collaborating across different roles.  

✅ **What Went Well**  
The website was successfully built and launched, with the backend fetching PM₂.₅
data and generating clear country-level insights (DALYs). Our progress made the
results accessible, and my contributions helped make the presentation more
understandable.  

⚠️ **What Could Be Improved**  
Integrating backend and frontend took longer than expected. Explaining DALYs
clearly for a broad audience was challenging, and seeking feedback earlier could
have improved both the website and presentation faster.  

### 👤 Falaq Majeed  

🧠 **What we learned**  
We learned how to map our journey from the starting point to developing a tool
that reflects our complex research into just 8 slides that could casually present
our work. Along the way, we also gained new skills related to building and improving
the website.  

✅ **What went well**  
The tool was successfully finalized, and the feedback Evan gave us on the website
was really valuable. His input helped us make the site more informative and
organized.  

⚠️ **What could be improved**  
We underestimated the effort required for the slides and their transcript. We
didn’t anticipate how challenging it would be to prepare them within the limited
time available.  

### 👤 Salih Adam  

🧠 **What you learned**  

- How to display information at a high level  
- How to emphasize the right information in a short timeframe  

✅ **What went well**  

- We improved the website and the tool that displays our model  
- We brainstormed well and selected the right sections to include in the
  presentation  

⚠️ **What could be improved**  

- We could have distributed presentation roles earlier so everyone had more time
  to prepare their parts.  
- We could have each brought forward draft slides to compare more ideas and
  create a more inclusive presentation.
