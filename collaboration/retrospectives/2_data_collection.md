# üß† Retrospective ‚Äî Milestone 2: Data Collection

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- We successfully identified two high-quality and publicly available data sources:
  WHO for PM2.5 concentrations and IHME for health outcomes that directly support
  our research question.

- The team made strong progress in understanding the structure and limitations of
both datasets.

- Collaborative tools and solid communication structure enabled us to
  overcome organizational obstacles.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Challenging

- Coordinating decisions around data selection took longer than expected due to
  varied preferences and approaches.

- Finding suitable data for health outcomes was quite challenging and time-consuming.

- The debate around refining the research question in light of the available data
  continued for a long period.

---

## üí° What We Learned

- Choosing relevant and compatible datasets is just as important as analysis  
  itself.

- A clear and shared definition of key variables is crucial to avoid confusion.

- Thorough documentation of dataset structure and sources makes it easier for  
  others to reuse or validate our work.

- We learned the value of an iterative process, revisiting both the data and the
  research question to ensure they align effectively.

---

## üîÑ What We‚Äôll Improve Next

- Streamlining decision-making earlier in the milestone by setting clearer criteria.

- Strengthen coordination and communication as we transition into analysis,  
  especially with a larger team following the group merger.

- Improve collaborative planning by setting clear roles and expectations early in
  the milestone.

- Foster more active participation in discussions and decision-making to keep  
  momentum steady.

- Leverage the increased team capacity to distribute tasks more effectively and
  improve overall productivity.

## üéØ Strategy vs. Board

### ‚úÖ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- WHO and IHME were confirmed as our primary sources, and both provided  
  downloadable, well-documented data.

- The team completed the core data cleaning and was able to produce a merged dataset
  on schedule.

- Github collaboration tools provided the expected level of support.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What parts of your plan did not work out?

- A good dataset for city level analysis was not found

- Agreeing on which diseases and metrics to include took multiple rounds of discussion.

---

### ‚ûï Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We expanded the scope of analysis to countries level.

- A fallback strategy for long IHME download queues was discussed (e.g.,
  smaller queries or pre-processed subsets).
- We scheduled additional meetings to coordinate our integration into a larger group.

---

### ‚ûñ Or remove extra steps?

- We excluded pollutants other than PM2.5, as the data did not align with our
  original research objective.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Mohamed Tilal

#### What I Learned

- I learned that working with more people in a team can make things better and
  more effective.
- I learned how to collect data more carefully.
- I improved my ability to refine and narrow down a research question based on
  what data is actually available.

#### What Went Well

- After the merge, working with the new team was easier than I expected.
- The team was welcoming, and we were able to align and continue working on the
  milestone smoothly.

#### What Could Be Improved / Challenges

- The merge process took time and affected the flow of work.
- After the merge, I spent most of my time reading through the new repository and
  trying to better understand the new work process.

### Hussaini Ahmed

#### What I learned

- Techniques for sourcing high-quality, relevant datasets.
- The importance of data relevance, accuracy, and ethical sourcing.
- How to assess data completeness and consistency early on.

#### What went well

- Successfully identified and collected datasets that align with the project goals.
- Maintained proper documentation of sources and collection process.

#### What Could Be Improved

- Spent too much time sourcing and cleaning due to inconsistencies.

### Linah Khayri

üß† What I Learned

- The importance of patience and adaptability when working on group projects
  
- The value of defining clear goals at the start of a project

- Gained experience in data searching and learned to critically
  assess and question data sources

- Developed skills in cleaning messy datasets and choosing appropriate visualizations
  to communicate insights effectively

‚úÖ What Went Well

- We were able to reach a common understanding and work collaboratively as a team

- Clearly defined objectives made data selection more efficient and focused

‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Be Improved

- Thoroughly reviewing and assisting with datasets early on could have saved time

- Avoiding delays by setting realistic deadlines and time buffers

- Consistent check-ins on Slack or WhatsApp would have improved communication

### Saliha Kalender

üß†**What I Learned**

I learned how to successfully find and gather datasets that match our project
goals, and how to clearly document their sources and processing steps. This
process also taught me to be more careful and intentional when selecting and
organizing data, and I saw how choosing a clear direction gives the project
more meaning.

‚úÖ**What Went Well**

We were able to successfully find and gather datasets that matched our project
objectives, and we kept clear records of where the data came from and how it
was processed.

‚ö†Ô∏è**What Could Be Improved**

Merging with the other group took some time, and it also took a little while for
newer members to fully adapt to the group rhythm ‚Äî but I believe things will run
more smoothly in the next milestone.
Going forward, it might help to define roles and expectations more clearly. At
times, unclear communication or delays slowed our progress, so improving regular
check-ins could help us stay more aligned and efficient.

### Falaq Majeed

‚ú®**What I learned**

- The importance of patience when working on group projects.

- How to clean data and present the cleaning process clearly in notebooks.

- How to choose visuals that effectively explain and highlight relationships in
  the data.

- The value and impact of thorough data exploration.

‚úÖ **What went well**

- We managed to define a research question grounded in the feasibility of our
  available data.

- We completed all the milestone tasks within the deadline.

‚ö†Ô∏è **What could be improved**

- Enhancing group communication and discussion on Slack and WhatsApp, rather than
  relying solely on meetings for decisions.

- Regularly updating the group through check-ins.

- Reviewing the guides and syllabus more thoroughly to ensure we stay aligned
  with requirements.

### Salih Adam

üß† What we learned

- We learned how to access and align global datasets from WHO and IHME, and the
importance of consistent structure, naming, and time frames during data cleaning.

‚úÖ What went well

- We identified reliable data sources, completed cleaning for both datasets, and
  coordinated well as a team throughout the process.

‚ö†Ô∏è What could be improved

- Coordination and decision-making could have been faster during the data selection
phase, especially when narrowing down health indicators and countries.
