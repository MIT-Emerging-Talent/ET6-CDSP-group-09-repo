**Atmosfear** is a data science group project that explores the global
challenge of air pollution and its impact on public health. Our goal is to
uncover patterns in how different pollutants dominate across world cities and
how these patterns relate to regional trends in respiratory and cardiovascular
illnesses. By identifying these pollutant profiles and their health
correlations, we aim to fill a critical research gap and hopefully support
more targeted, pollutant-specific policy interventions.

Air pollution is one of the most underestimated killers in the world today.
Unlike more visible threats, polluted air is invisible and easy to ignore
until it becomes personal. You can't see it, but it's there: silently entering
lungs, aggravating asthma, triggering heart conditions, and cutting lives
short.

According to the WHO (2023) and GBD (2024), air pollution contributes to an
estimated **7 million premature deaths each year** due to its strong links
with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, stroke, and lung cancer. It's
not just an environmental crisis; it's a public health emergency hiding in
plain sight.

One of our group members shared a personal story: her mother, who has asthma,
experiences severe discomfort when staying in cities where it is polluted.
Even short visits can mean weeks of relying on medications, constant coughing,
and the simple wish to breathe without pain. For her and millions with
similar and different health conditions, clean air isn’t just a preference,
it’s a necessity.
**But is it feasible to find cities where the air is truly safe for
vulnerable individuals?**

impacts, and why a deeper pollutant-specific analysis is needed.

>**How do respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes vary across global cities in 2024 when categorized by their dominant air pollutant?**

 This question stems from our shared concern about the growing impact of air pollution on public health worldwide. It holds personal significance for us, as we’ve witnessed firsthand how polluted environments affect the well-being of our own communities. Our research is grounded in the broader context of global health inequities and shaped by the practical limitations of a defined research timeframe and the scope of publicly available data
