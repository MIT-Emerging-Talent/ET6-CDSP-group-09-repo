# Communication Artifact

Our team created a website that blends data-driven insights with human-centered
storytelling to effectively communicate the health impacts of air pollution and
its connection to COVID-19 mortality.  

We chose a website as our primary communication medium because it allows us
to:  

- Reach a broad, diverse audience including researchers, policymakers, and
global health organizations.  
- Present complex data interactively through maps, filters, and country-level
snapshots, making information accessible and engaging.  
- Update and expand content dynamically as new data and findings become
available.  

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:**  

- University researchers, epidemiologists, and government analysts focused on
air pollution, environmental health, or non-communicable diseases.  
- Institutions like the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and
OpenAQ, which host or disseminate air quality‚Äìrelated data and insights.  

**Secondary:**  

- Global health organizations such as WHO and UNEP  
- Policy think tanks specializing in environmental justice or urban health  
- Academic journals, data science networks, and public health communication
platforms

## Core Message  

_Long-term PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure compounds global health inequalities ‚Äî increasing
cardiovascular and respiratory disease burdens, especially in low-SDI countries.
Reducing air pollution isn't just environmental policy; it's public health
justice._

## Artifacts

### üåê Interactive Website

**Purpose:** To share data-driven insights and interactive visualizations with
public health researchers, policymakers, and international organizations.  

**Website Link:**  
[https://linahkhayri.github.io/atmosfear-website/](https://linahkhayri.github.io/atmosfear-website/)  

**Key Features:**  

- Dynamic Maps: Country-level trends in PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure and related disease
burdens

## üìÑ Policy Brief

**Title:** Addressing Long-Term Health Impacts of Air Pollution and COVID-19
Mortality in LMICs  

**Issue Summary:**  
Ambient fine particulate matter (PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ) pollution has long been a silent threat
to public health, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Our research analyzes PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure from 2010 to 2019 and its impact
on cardiovascular and respiratory disease burdens as well as COVID-19 mortality
rates, revealing persistent inequalities linked to socio-demographic factors.  

**Key Findings:**  

- Long-term PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure correlates with increased cardiovascular and
respiratory Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), especially in countries
with low Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) scores.  
- Vulnerable populations in LMICs face higher pollution levels and health
burdens.  
- A modest but significant association exists between historical PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure
and increased COVID-19 mortality in 2020.  
- SDI is the strongest predictor of health outcomes, with PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ as a consistent
secondary predictor.  

**Evidence-Based Policy Recommendations:**  

- Strengthen air quality monitoring and data transparency  
- Prioritize pollution reduction in public health policy  
- Support vulnerable populations through targeted health interventions  
- Promote international collaboration and funding  

**Website Link:** The policy brief is available on the project website
([https://linahkhayri.github.io/atmosfear-website/](https://linahkhayri.github.io/atmosfear-website/))
to complement the interactive data visualizations and support evidence-based
decision making.

### Call to Action  

We urge governments, health agencies, and international partners to recognize
the compounded risks posed by long-term air pollution and pandemics. Immediate,
coordinated action is essential to reduce health inequalities and save lives in
vulnerable communities.
