## Strategy Summary

Our communication approach focuses on delivering **data-driven insights** through
**human-centered storytelling**, targeting decision-makers, researchers, and
global health organizations.  
We use an **interactive website** and **policy-oriented materials** to make
complex air pollution and COVID-19 mortality data understandable, actionable,
and impactful.

### Who We’re Reaching

- **Primary:** University researchers, epidemiologists, government analysts,
and institutions such as IHME and OpenAQ.
- **Secondary:** WHO, UNEP, policy think tanks, academic journals, and public
health networks.

### What We’re Saying

Long-term PM₂.₅ exposure worsens cardiovascular and respiratory health,
amplifying inequalities in low-SDI countries. Reducing air pollution is not
only an environmental goal it’s public health justice.

### Why

To empower organizations, researchers, and policymakers with the evidence and
tools they need to **advocate for, design, and implement** effective public
health interventions and environmental policies.
