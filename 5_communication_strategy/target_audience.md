# Target Audience Document

## Introduction

Our research provides technical insights of significant value to audiences engaged
in environmental and public health research. These findings have the potential
to benefit both large health and environmental organizations as well as researchers,
whether professional or student. We categorize our audience into two main groups:

1. Environmental and Public Health Organizations such as IHME, WHO, and OpenAQ  
2. Researchers, both established professionals and students, who can integrate
   our findings into their own studies and projects  

## Audience Group 1: Environmental and Public Health Organizations

Examples: IHME, WHO, OpenAQ, national public health agencies

### Group 1 Capabilities  

- Deep expertise in epidemiology, environmental monitoring, and public health
  policy  
- Access to large-scale, multi-country datasets and advanced analytical
  resources  
- Strong infrastructure for disseminating evidence-based recommendations to
  governments, NGOs, and the public  

### Group 1 Constraints

- Need for robust, peer-reviewed evidence before adopting new models or
  recommendations  
- Complex and often slow decision-making processes  
- Competing global health priorities that can reduce immediate attention to air
  pollution  

### How we intend to reach Group 1

- Engage through official organizational platforms, direct email campaigns, and
  LinkedIn pages  
- Use our project website (AtmosFear) as a central hub for technical documentation,
  downloadable results, and interactive tools  

### What we would like Group 1 to learn (Core Message)

- PM₂.₅ levels significantly influence cardiovascular and respiratory disease
  burdens  
- Our model uses average PM₂.₅ data at the country level combined with
  socio-economic indices to accurately predict these burdens  
- This approach can generate synthetic data and forecast potential health improvements
  from pollution reduction initiatives  

### How we hope Group 1 will act

- Integrate our model into health risk assessment frameworks  
- Advocate for air quality regulations and targeted interventions  
- Support further research applying or extending our methodology to new regions
  or scales

## Audience Group 2: Researchers (Professionals and Students)

### Group 2 Capabilities

- Skilled in statistical analysis, modeling, and environmental health research  
- Able to adapt methodologies for specialized contexts  
- Often looking for innovative approaches to address existing research gaps  

### Group 2 Constraints

- May lack access to high-quality or large-scale environmental health datasets  
- Limited funding and tight deadlines  
- Require clear methodological transparency to replicate results  

### How we intend to reach Group 2

- Share our work in technical and academic communities on platforms such as
  LinkedIn, Facebook, and other scholarly networking sites  
- Provide open-access datasets, code, and tutorials through GitHub and our
  website  

### What we would like Group 2 to learn (Core Message)

- PM₂.₅ pollution is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and respiratory disease
  burdens  
- Our model combines PM₂.₅ averages with socio-economic data to produce accurate,
  actionable predictions  
- The model can generate synthetic datasets for areas where monitoring data is
  limited  

### How we hope Group 2 will act

- Apply our model in their research to expand understanding of air pollution’s
  health impacts  
- Cite our work in publications, presentations, and policy briefs  
- Adapt the model to different geographic or temporal scales for scenario testing
