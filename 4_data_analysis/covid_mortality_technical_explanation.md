# Technical Description of PM₂.₅ Health Impact Analysis Related to COVID-19 Mortality

We explored how **chronic exposure to PM₂.₅** and **socio-demographic development
(SDI)** influenced **age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rates in 2020** across
approximately 190 countries.

## Data & Preprocessing

Using country-level data, we:

- Calculated **10-year average PM₂.₅ concentrations** (2010–2019).

- Collected **2020 COVID-19 age-standardized death rates** (per 100,000 population).

- Integrated **2020 SDI values** to account for differences in national
development levels.

## Methodology

We applied a combination of **traditional statistical models** and **machine
learning approaches** to assess:

- Whether long-term **PM₂.₅ exposure is a meaningful predictor** of COVID-19 mortality.

- How the **relationship varies with national SDI levels**.

- Whether **nonlinear or distributional patterns** exist across the mortality spectrum.

### Models Used

- Linear Regression  

- Log-Transformed Regression  

- Interaction Models (PM₂.₅ × SDI)  

- Random Forest Regression  

- Spline Regression  

- Quantile Regression

## Summary of Findings

- **PM₂.₅** is a **modest but statistically significant predictor** of COVID-19
mortality in both statistical and machine learning models.

- **SDI** is also significant, showing a **strong negative association** with mortality.

- No significant linear interaction was found in OLS models, but nonlinear spline
models detected meaningful PM₂.₅ × SDI interactions.

- Quantile regression revealed that PM₂.₅’s effects are more pronounced in countries
with lower COVID-19 mortality.

- Machine learning models explained up to 40% of the variance, capturing nonlinear
and interaction effects more effectively than linear models.

## Confidence and Uncertainty

- Across models, **confidence intervals for PM₂.₅ coefficients generally did not
include zero**, supporting their statistical significance.

- SDI also showed a **consistent and significant negative effect** on mortality.

- Interaction terms (PM₂.₅ × SDI) had wide confidence intervals often including
zero, indicating **weaker or inconclusive evidence** for interaction effects.

- Nonlinear and machine learning models indicated greater variability, but still
suggested a context-dependent relationship between PM₂.₅ and COVID-19 mortality.

Despite signs of significance, effect sizes remain modest, and uncertainty is
nontrivial, reflected in:

- Partial violations of model assumptions,  

- The presence of influential observations,  

- And moderate R² values.

These results should be interpreted with caution, considering potential
unmeasured confounders and limitations of country-level modeling.

## Interpretation and Recommendations

While our analysis demonstrates **significant but modest associations** between
long-term PM₂.₅ exposure and COVID-19 mortality, it also highlights the complexity
of global pandemic outcomes. These results support the hypothesis that
**environmental and socio-demographic factors** may influence national COVID-19 impacts.

### Future research should

- Include more covariates (e.g., healthcare system capacity, vaccination rates,
population age structure),

- Use sub-national or individual-level data to enhance resolution,

- And consider causal inference methods to explore the directionality and
magnitude of effects.

## Contextualizing Our Findings with External Evidence

Although our study’s findings are modest and not conclusive, they are consistent
with a larger body of scientific evidence showing that chronic PM₂.₅ exposure
increases vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality and severity.

Several independent and peer-reviewed studies support this:

- [Wu et al. (2020)][1]
- [Pozzer et al. (2020)][2]

[2]: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7277007/  

Even though our analysis alone doesn’t establish a strong causal relationship,
it contributes to a broader scientific understanding that long-term air
pollution may exacerbate pandemic outcomes, particularly in more vulnerable or
less developed settings.
