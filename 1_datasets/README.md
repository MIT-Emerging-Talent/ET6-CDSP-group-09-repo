# ðŸ§  Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

In this project, we are studying how **long-term air pollutionâ€”especially**
**PM2.5â€”affects human health across different countries**. We decided to use a
**country-level PM2.5 concentration dataset** along with **respiratory and**
**cardiovascular disease burden data** from the **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)**
**study**.

For now, we are focusing on **25 diverse countries** from different regions and
development levels, based on the availability of reliable data. We plan to look
at **trends in PM2.5 levels over time** and see how they relate to
**health outcomes like asthma, heart disease, and stroke**. Later, we may expand
the analysis to include more countries for
**broader comparisons and stronger statistical results**.

Our approach allows us to explore the **lag effect**â€”the idea that
**long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to health problems years later**.
This helps us understand not just whatâ€™s happening now, but
**what pollution over the last decade might have caused**.

As an additional layer, weâ€™ll also look at whether countries with
**higher long-term air pollution exposure experienced higher COVID-19 death**
**rates**, possibly because **pollution had already weakened lung or heart**
**health** before the pandemic.

We are also considering the **Socio-demographic Index (SDI)** of each country.
This helps us explore how **development levelâ€”like access to healthcare and**
**public policyâ€”might affect the link between pollution and health**.

In short, our goal is to turn **complex environmental and health data into clear**
**insights**. By finding patterns across countries, we hope this project can
support more **targeted and effective public health policies**.

**Clean air is not just about the environmentâ€”itâ€™s about protecting peopleâ€™s lives.**
